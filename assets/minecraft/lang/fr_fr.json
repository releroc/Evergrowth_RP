  "gm4_pb.hint.9":"Boxes above the\n Box you're pushing will follow the bottom Box, but only if they're able to.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.10":"Pushing a stack will try to bring along all Boxes, but if a Box gets blocked that and all Boxes above will be left behind.",

  "gm4_pb.hint.12":"Try to get a Box in a useful position between the platforms without moving the other Boxes.",

  "gm4_pb.hint.16":"The solution might be hidden in the environment, don't forget that any part of the room you can access is important!",
  "gm4_pb.hint.17":"Remember that the puzzle is in a 3D environment. Boxes can be used to walk on and reach otherwise inaccessible area's.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.18":"You cannot push two Boxes in a row. This can sometimes be used to your advantage.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.19":"While chains will hold up Boxes from gravity they don't stop any direct pushing from disconnecting said Box.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.20":"Take complicated puzzles one step at a time. Start with the most difficult step, then go from there.",

  "gm4_pb.hint.24":"You're in a 3D world. Always check where you can climb as higher elevations usually grant more options.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.25":"Getting the Battery stuck on the chain will not lead to the solution. Is there another direction you could approach the plug from?",

  "gm4_pb.hint.35":"Pistons will only push anything directly in their path, and can push multiple Boxes at once!",
  "gm4_pb.hint.36":"You only need to be mostly inside a block to be able to push from it, as long as the block is a valid pushing location.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.37":"Pistons will break if they try to extend while blocked by Boxes they cannot move.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.38":"When in an open area trying other puzzles when you're stuck might give you new ideas on how to interact with mechanics.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.39":"Pistons will push any amount of Boxes in front of them.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.40":"Large puzzles can feel very overwhelming when you see them at first. Try to break them into smaller steps and complete those one by one.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.41":"When holding the Reset button Boxes that would be reset will glow red.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.42":"Ice is usually easier to think about if you work backwards.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.43":"Working backwards from the solution to the start is usually a good method when ice is involved.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.44":"Pushing a Box into another Box on ice will cause it to come to a stop.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.45":"Boxes sliding on ice will stop if they leave the ice, hit another Box or hit terrain.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.46":"If two Boxes are in a loop on the ice it's possible to swap their order in the caterpillar.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.47":"A Box could be used to stop another sliding Box from going into the water.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.48":"You can push two Boxes into eachother one after the other, creating a caterpillar that can move across the slippery surface.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.49":"Boxes can be used as terrain to stop sliding Boxes.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.50":"Wooden Crates can be pushed by other Boxes, but they cannot hold down buttons.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.51":"The puzzle can be solved with only 2 pushes on the metal Box, which are also the last two pushes.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.52":"Wooden Crates are able to bring along Boxes on top of them, even if not pushed directly.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.53":"Just because a puzzle seems set up for one final push as the solution doesn't mean you need to follow that path.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.54":"A chain will stop sliding Boxes in the same way as if the block below was not ice to begin with.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.55":"Bumping a Box into a Wooden Crate on ice will transfer its momentum to the Wooden Crate, stopping the Box.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.56":"Blocks do not fall instantly when there is no ground below them.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.57":"Magnets have no effect on Wooden Crates, making them great methods of stopping a Box from moving.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.58":"If a Box is not moved by a magnet beam it can slide through it over ice without losing momentum.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.59":"Magnet beams do not go through Boxes, allowing a Box to hide from its effects behind another Box.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.60":"Boxes cannot normally leave a 3x3 area around another Box without pushing both Boxes.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.61":"Wooden Crates can be used to stop a Box from moving in a magnet beam.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.62":"When you're unsure how to start try solving the puzzle by working from the end back to a position you do know how to get to.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.63":"Boxes will ignore conveyors while sliding on ice, unless you stop them on top of a conveyor.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.64":"A single conveyor is not able to push multiple Boxes in a row.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.65":"Consider what end state would allow you to solve the puzzle. Remember that pushing a Box into a Wooden Crate will cause the Wooden Crate to move.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.66":"Remember that any part of the puzzle that you can access can be used in its solution.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.67":"Resetting a puzzle will not reset Boxes from other puzzles, check the red outline if you're not sure.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.68":"If a teleporter does not have a valid destination it will not teleport. Look for the pulsing center to see if a teleporter is currently active.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.69":"Boxes pushed through teleporters will keep their momentum, if they have any.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.70":"When a Box is pushed out of a teleporter Boxes in matching teleporters will try to teleport to the new open spot.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.71":"Teleporters will always prefer the closest unoccupied teleporter.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.72":"A Wooden Crate can be pushed against a conveyor direction by pushing it with a Box.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.73":"Any area included in a puzzle is usually helpful. Consider why the environment looks the way it does.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.74":"Consider how to set yourself up to complete the puzzle while you still have space to move Boxes around.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.75":"Complicated puzzles are best taken slowly, going step by step and checking if what you did worked. Remember that you can always Undo",
  "gm4_pb.hint.76":"You are unable to push two Boxes in a row. This can be used to push from a location without pushing a Box next to you.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.77":"You cannot push from the top of a teleporter, but you can if there is a Box inside.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.78":"If a powered piston is unable to push it will break instead.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.79":"A Box can shield another Box from a magnet beam.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.80":"If a teleporter has no valid place to teleport to it won't activate. You can push Boxes through unactivated teleporters.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.81":"You might need to use a more complicated loop to set up a caterpillar of Boxes.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.82":"Boxes aren't added to puzzles for no reason. Even if a Box appears stuck from the start see if you can make use of it.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.83":"You can use the fact that the top of Boxes are not slippery to move the Battery with more control.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.84":"Magnet beams can be blocked by Boxes to allow other Boxes past. Alternatively Wooden Crates can be used to block the movement.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.85":"Always consider why the environment looks how it looks. Extra space is usually there for a reason.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.86":"You can sneak around a pillar using just a diagonal connection.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.87":"When a piston is in the way, remember that it's possible to break them by powering them when they cannot push.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.88":"The top face of an upwards facing piston can be pushed from.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.89":"A magnet beam that doesn't move a Box will not cause the Box to lose it's momentum.",
  "gm4_pb.hint.90":"Consider from where you could push a Box to reach the teleporter. Is it possible to make a way to push from there?",
  "gm4_pb.hint.91":"Take the puzzle one step at a time. See each portion as a new smaller puzzle to overcome. And remember: pistons can be broken by powering them when they cannot push!",

There's all sorts of fun things there, like superfluidity or superconductivity.\n\nBut absolute zero? Never.\n\nWhy? Because of entropy. Entropy is often defined as the amount of randomness – or chaos – in a system. At the lowest temperature particles no longer move, they cannot interact anymore. No change means no chaos.\n\nBut entropy does not like being reduced, and it *really* does not like absolute zero.\n\n",
